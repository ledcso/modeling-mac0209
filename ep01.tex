\begin{abstract}
In digital signal processing, the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem establishes that the sample rate must be at least twice the bandwidth of the signal to avoid aliasing. 
We study the functions sine, logarithm, and arctan, do a sampling of them, and quantize the data to reconstruct the signal into a discrete-time one.

\section{Introduction}

In digital electronics, digital signals are represented as pulse waves, which are usually generated by the switching of a transistor. 
Due to the nature of pulse waves, signal processing is best done through the use of discrete-time functions, in contrast to raw signals which are usually represented byu continuous-time functions. 
In that vein, we convert the continuous-time signal to a discrete-time one, through a process called quantization. 
The first step in the quantization of a signal is sampling, which involves getting a "sample" of the original continuous-time function and use it to reconstruct the signal to obtain a discrete-time one. 

\section{Objectives}

To understand the concepts of precision, accuracy, and significant figures, as well as analyze the errors from sampling, taking into account the Nyquist-Shannon theorem.

\section{Discussion}

We applied the Nyquist-Shannon theorem when choosing our frequency for sampling to avoid aliasing during the interpolation of the discrete-time signal, and verified the theorem by getting a new function with a frequency not lower than the original continuous-time signal. 
Even though the three functions were simple ones, the functions sine, log, and arctan, are representative of real-life signals, and let us apply quantization and the Nyquist-Shannon theorem in a controlled manner.
